   - [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go): A sandbox for app development with Expo.

3. **Customize your project**:
   Edit the files inside the `app` directory to start developing. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## 💻 Fresh Start

When you're ready to start a new project:
```bash
