## 🚀 Get Started

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the app**:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   You’ll find options to open the app in:
   - A [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
   - An [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
   - An [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
   - [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go): A sandbox for app development with Expo.

3. **Customize your project**:
   Edit the files inside the `app` directory to start developing. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## 💻 Fresh Start

When you're ready to start a new project:
```bash
npm run reset-project
```
This will move the starter code to the `app-example` directory and create a blank `app` directory for your development.
